# BotNation

A project to automate the administration of a simulated [NationState](https://www.nationstates.net/).

Each nation has 3 main indicators:
- Civil Rights
- Economy
- Political Freedom

There also exist a large number of census ranging from the population to averageness which are used to rank the NationState to others in the world and region.

Every so often, issues will be raised, the responses to which will affect the various census and indicators.

The objective of this bot is to select responses which will maximise or minimise select indicators.
